## **Project Description**

This is a financial data science project that finds arbitrage opportunities between the NYSE, NASDAQ and London Stock Exchange. This involves looking for companies that are listed in more than one exchange and try to take advantage of price discrepancy and exchange rates by buying a stock of a company in one exchange and sell it in another one.

It is a GUI-based application that uses  [Financial Modeling Prep's](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/) free financial data API.

## **Usage**


### Creating a Free Account
<br>

First, to be able to use the **free API**, you need to register an account in **Financial Modeling Prep's** website. The registering process is **fairly simple and does not take much of your time**. You can do it in [this](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/register) page. After this you need to select the **"Free Plan"** to be able to use it.

<br>


### Obtaining the API Key and Preparing the Config File
<br>

To access your API Key, you need to copy the key from this [webpage](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/dashboard/). Then open the `config.py` file with Notepad or any other text editor of your choice and paste it where it says `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`. Then, save the file.

<br>



### Running the Script
<br>

Finally, to use it just run the python script and a GUI window will appear on your screen with a table like the one below.

<br>
